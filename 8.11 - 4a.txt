; 8.11 - 4 - FindThrees Procedure

; This is optimized version of FindThree procedure.
; Previous version was using 3 registers to accumulate three consequtive values of 3:
; mov eax, [esi]
; cmp eax, 3
; jne EXIT
; mov ebx, [esi + 4]
; ............
; mov edx, [esi + 8]
; The major disadvantage of this procedure is that it could be applyed only to
; limited sequence of 'threes' (3 or 4), because the number of registers is limited.

; Current program permits to overcome this limitation, using 2 loops.
; First loop only recieve the offset of array and then transmits it to second loop.
; Second loop has counter = 3, because secuence of 3 "threes" is in question.
; Second loop screen first element of array, if it s 3, then loop screens second element, and further.
; When all 3 consequtive elements are "threes", then jmp out of first loop.
; WriteDec subroutine prints the position of sequence.
;Otherwise the length of array is printed.
