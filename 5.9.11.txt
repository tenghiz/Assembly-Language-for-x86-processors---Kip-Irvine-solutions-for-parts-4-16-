; 5.9.11 - Finding multiples

; First loop of this program push numbers form M to 1 to stack.M is bigger than N, otherwise during the last step
; popped number will something like 0777BB..., so we risk to enter endless loop L5, because condition cmp eax, N will be corrupted.
; Second loop first calculates multiples of 2 (2, 4, 6...).EBX is set to 1 from the beginning
; in order to avoid endless loop L5 and L3.Multiple of 2 put first in array1.Next step : current multiple of 2
; is compared to M. if equal or bigger, then jge L4 - exit.
; Next we pop numbers from stack to edx(1 to N).Number in edx is compared to eax.If numbers are not equal,
; then jump to L5, where we pop next number from stack.If edx is equal to eax, then jmp to L3, where 1 is inserted to
; corresponding  position in array2.

; stack: M M-1 M-2 ... 3 2 1
; array1: 02 04 06 08...
; array2: 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1...
