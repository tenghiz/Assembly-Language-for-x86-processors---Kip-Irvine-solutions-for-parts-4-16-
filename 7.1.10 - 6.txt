; 7.1.10 - 6 - Count parity
; program counts first all binary 1 in hex number, counter is ebx
; in the end ebx will contain even number(even parity) or odd number(odd parity)
; the easiest way to distinguish even and odd numebrs is to check their LSB
; LSB = 0, even number; LSB = 1, odd number.Program checks LSB using shr command
; there is no direct way to set parity flag
; so we perform XOR operation between some aleatory numbers and 0 to set parity flag accordingly to carry flag
