; 8.11 - 1 - FindLargest

; Algorithm:
; Each value is compared to all members of array.
; If a given value is lower than some member of an array,
; than value is switched to next member, which in its turn also compared to all members of array.
; If a given value is bigger than all compared members, than comparison is finished.
