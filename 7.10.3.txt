; 7.10.3 - transform 4 - byte packed decimal to a string of ASCII digits
; we use SHLD instruction with count 4 which permits to separate each hexadecimal digit
; and transform it to ASCII applying OR 30h mask

; for unknown reason this instruction doesn t allow to shift the lowest nibble
; shld eax, ebx, 32. doesn t work
; so, if packed BCD is 12345678h, it will be shown as 12345677

;this problem was bypassed applying OR 30h mask separately on the lowest nibble
