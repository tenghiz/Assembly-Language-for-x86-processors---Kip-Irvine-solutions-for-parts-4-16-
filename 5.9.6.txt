mov esp, ebx; value of esp points to the top of letters in stack
mov eax, 10; here we choose randomly some letter from stack
call RandomRange
mov edx, type dword
mul edx; multiplication is actually eax*edx, but eax is never mentioned
add esp, eax; now esp points to random letter in stack
pop eax
sub eax, 32; popped letter is in lower case.Difference between upper and lower case in ASCII is 32
mov string1[esi], al; letter in string1 is in upper case

; we could create a procedure to debug this program faster.
; PushStack proc works well, but some unknown error is generated later, precisely eax gets in L2 some strane values.
; Thus we prefer to work without supplementary procedures

PushStack proc
mov ebx, esp; we have to save esp value before implementing push command
mov esi, 0
mov ecx, lengthof string
L1:
movzx eax, string[esi]
push eax
inc esi
loop L1
mov edx, esp; here edx will point to the top of letters in stack
mov esp, ebx; now esp points to return address of procedure
ret
PushStack endp
