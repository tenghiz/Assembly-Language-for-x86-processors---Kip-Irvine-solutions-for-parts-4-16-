; 11.8 - 11 - Linked List(correct version, 2nd modification)

; Linked list is a linear collection of data elements,
; in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory(sic!).

; In this program HeapAlloc is called inside of the loop,
; so nodes are not represented as a linear sequence of heap addresses.
