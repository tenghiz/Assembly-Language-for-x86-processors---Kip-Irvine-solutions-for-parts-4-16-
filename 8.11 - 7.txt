; 8.11 - 7 - Greatest common divisor

; This program is based on Euclid s algorithm.
; Let s suppose there are two numbers A and B.If A and B have GCD,
; then A - B = C can also be divided by the same GCD.
; How to implement this idea to calculation of GDP ?
; Let s suppose that A is greater than B.Substraction A - B gives C.
; Now we have numbers B and C.Now substraction is performed one more time.
; ................
; Substraction is performed until both numbers are equal.This is GCD.
