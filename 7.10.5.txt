; In order to generate all prime numbers in a given limit,
; each number from 0 to(given limit) is successively
; tested by division on a given set of starting prime numbers(here named divisors 2, 3, 5, 7, etc)

; If actual number can be divided by 2, the program skips all other divisors
; and switches to the next number in range of tested values.
; Otherwise, next divisor is used.
; If actual number can not be divided on a last divisor,
; then it is considered as a prime number.

; In this program the lower limit of range is the last divisor + 1.
; So, divisors and occasional composite numbers between them are not included in range of tested values.
