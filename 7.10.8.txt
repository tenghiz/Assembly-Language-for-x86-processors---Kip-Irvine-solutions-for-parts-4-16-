; 7.10.8 - Add Packed Integers

; This program don t use ADC instruction

; If CF = 1, then ebx = 1 and it is added to the resulting sum.

; The key feature of this program is combination of
; pop and push instructions together with JC.
; Before loop begins, ebx = 0 and it s pushed to the stack.
; When first component is added to al, ebx is popped and added to al.
; Finally second component is added.

; If this addition generates CF = 1, then ebx = 1. This value pushed to the stack inside the loop.
; When loop repeats, previously pushed value popped back to ebx and it s added to new sum.
